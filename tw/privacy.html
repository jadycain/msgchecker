          <p>The “Company” uses your “Personal Data” (under some circumstances, combined with “Non-identifiable Data”) in order to provide the “Messenger Checker Service” and respond to your search primarily.</p>

          <h3>Technical Data.</h3>
          <p>When you access the “Website” or interact with some service provided by us, or you are provided with or fed back some open information by the Company upon your access to the “Messenger Checker Service”, as a “Registered User”, “Non-registered User” or “Messenger Checker Visitor”, our server will automatically record some data received or transmitted from your browser, so that we might keep the log for the information accessed or received by you due to access to the services.
